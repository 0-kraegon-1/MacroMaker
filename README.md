# Welcome to my noob project
## Just experimenting with some computer input automation for fun in an FXML environment while also learning about git/github in the process.
###             ***Windows x64 installer in "Releases" section, but is currently an older version (v1.5)***

# Macro Maker v2
* Macro Maker helps users build and perform autonomous input actions with their computer.

* You can type or paste any normal text that can be found on a standard qwerty keyboard and the program will type it out into whatever selected text field you have chosen once the timer runs out.

* The program is able to create, save, and load text files from the API, to save macros for later use, provided it has privelages to write file data in its directory.

* Sliders are present in the "Edit" dropdown menu to control the delay between keystrokes and the amount of time to wait before starting the macro.
	* Text box in "Edit" dropdown menu controls how many times macro will repeat a full execution cycle. [default: 1]
	* Mouse & Keyboard combo macros only execute at one speed: Real-time recording and execution.


# Future Plans
* Manipulate mouse macro output to create subtle random deviations in pathing to next target position, making the movement more smooth.
* Locate/Click on a specific pixel color found on the screen.
	* Ability to scan for a specific color pallete within a specific range of click pos.
