# Welcome to my noob project
## Just experimenting with some computer input automation for fun in an FXML environment while also learning about git/github in the process.
### ***Windows installer in "Releases" section***

# Macro Maker v1.5
* Macro Maker is currently essentially just a keyboard macro executor.

* You can type or paste any normal text that can be found on a standard qwerty keyboard and the program will type it out into whatever selected text field you have chosen once the timer runs out.

* The program is able to create, save, and load text files from the API, to save macros for later use, provided it has privelages to write file data in its directory.

* Sliders are present in the "Edit" tab to control the delay between keystrokes and the amount of time to wait before begining the macro.


# Future Plans
* Mouse input recording, saving and executing.
* Simultaneous execution of recorded mouse & keystroke macros.
